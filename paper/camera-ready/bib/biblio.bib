   abstract    = {The paper addresses the cost of consensus algorithms. It
                 has been shown that in the best case, consensus can be
                 solved in two communication steps with f < n/2, and in
                 one communication step with f < n/3 (f is the maximum
                 number of faulty processes). This leads to a dilemma when
                 choosing a consensus algorithm: greater efficiency or
                 higher resiliency degree. Recently Lamport has proposed a
                 solution called Fast Paxos, for partly escaping from this
                 dilemma. The idea is to combine two types of rounds in a
                 single consensus algorithm: fast rounds and rounds of the
                 ordinary Paxos algorithm. In the best case, Fast Paxos
                 solves consensus in one fast round, that is it requires
                 only one communication step. Unfortunately, the
                 combination induces some time overhead, and so Fast Paxos
                 becomes more expensive than ordinary Paxos when fast
                 rounds do not succeed. In this paper we go one step
                 further: we show that it is possible to tentatively
                 execute a fast round before a classical round without any
                 time overhead if the fast round does not succeed.},

@TechReport{LABOS-REPORT-2007-002,
   abstract    = {The deferred update technique is a widely used approach
                 for building replicated database systems. Its fame stems
                 from the fact that read-only transactions can execute
                 locally to any single database replica, providing good
                 performance for workloads where transactions are mostly
                 of this type. In this paper, we analyze the deferred
                 update technique and show a number of characteristics and
                 limitations common to any replication protocol based on
                 it. Previous works on this replication method usually
                 start from a protocol and then argue separately that it
                 is based on the deferred update technique and satisfies
                 serializability. Differently, ours starts from the
                 abstract definition of a serializable database and
                 gradually changes it into an abstract deferred update
                 protocol. In doing that, we can formally characterize the
                 deferred update technique and rigorously prove its
                 properties. Moreover, our specification can be extended
                 to create new protocols or used to prove existing ones
                 correct.},

	abstract = {Atomic broadcast primitives allow fault-tolerant cooperation between sites in a distributed system. Unfortunately, the delay incurred before a message can be delivered makes it difficult to implement high performance, scalable applications on top of atomic broadcast primitives. A new approach has been proposed which, based on optimistic assumptions about the communication system, reduces the average delay for message delivery. We develop this idea further and present a replicated database architecture that employs the new atomic broadcast primitive in such a way that the coordination phase of the atomic broadcast is fully overlapped with the execution of transactions, providing high performance without relaxing transaction correctness},

   abstract    = {Message ordering is a fundamental abstraction in
                 distributed systems. However, usual ordering guarantees
                 are purely ``syntactic'', that is, message ``semantics''
                 is not taken into consideration, despite the fact that in
                 several cases semantic information about messages leads
                 to more efficient message ordering protocols. In this
                 paper we define the Generic Broadcast problem, which
                 orders the delivery of messages only if needed, based on
                 the semantics of the messages. Semantic information about
                 the messages is introduced in the system by a conflict
                 relation defined over messages. We show that Reliable and
                 Atomic Broadcast are special cases of Generic Broadcast,
                 and propose an algorithm that solves Generic Broadcast
                 efficiently. In order to assess efficiency, we introduce
                 the concept of deliver latency.},

   abstract    = {Classic Paxos is a round-based distributed consensus
                 algorithm. Normally, proposals are sent to the round
                 leader and decided in two communication steps more. Fast
                 Paxos extends Classic Paxos by allowing also fast rounds,
                 in which a decision can be learned in two communication
                 steps without relying on a leader but requiring bigger
                 quorums. We extend Fast Paxos and allow yet another sort
                 of round with multiple quorums of coordinators. Such new
                 rounds have the same expected latency and quorum size
                 requirements as classic rounds but do not rely on a
                 single leader, providing better availability and allowing
                 load balance. Fast rounds and ours have a different
                 liveness requirement: the absence of collisions---which
                 may happen if different values are proposed concurrently.
                 However, collisions are inherently more expensive in fast
                 rounds. We apply our algorithm to Generalized Consensus,
                 a generalization of agreement problems that can use
                 semantic information to avoid collisions.},

@Article{Sch97,
   abstract    = {Consensus is one of the most fundamental problems in the
                 context of fault-tolerant distributed computing. The
                 problem consists, given a set P of processes having each
                 an initial value vi, in deciding among P on a common
                 value v. In 1985, Fischer, Lynch and Paterson proved that
                 the consensus problem is not solvable in an asynchronous
                 system subject to a single process crash. In 1991,
                 Chandra and Toueg showed that, by augmenting the
                 asynchronous system model with a well defined
                 "unreliable" failure detector, consensus becomes
                 solvable. They also give an algorithm that solves
                 consensus using the <>S failure detector. In this paper
                 we propose a new consensus algorithm, also using the <>S
                 failure detector, that is more efficient than the
                 Chandra-Toueg consensus algorithm. We measure efficiency
                 by introducing the notion of "latency degree", which
                 defines the minimal number of communication steps needed
                 to solve consensus. The Chandra-Toueg algorithm has a
                 latency degree of 3 (it requires at least three
                 communication steps), whereas our early consensus
                 algorithm requires only two communication steps (latency
                 degree of 2). We believe that this is an interesting
                 result, which adds to our current understanding of the
                 cost of consensus algorithms based on <>S.},

@TechReport{200232/IC,
   abstract    = {This paper describes a new consensus algorithm for the
                 asynchronous message passing system model augmented with
                 an unreliable failure detector abstraction: channels are
                 reliable, processes can fail by crashing, and the
                 detection of crashes are not reliable. Our algorithm (a)
                 matches all known consensus lower bounds on (1) failure
                 detection, i.e., \Omega, (2) resilience, i.e., a majority
                 of correct processes, and (3) latency, i.e., two
                 communication steps for a global decision in nice runs
                 (when no process crashes and the failure detection is
                 reliable), and (b) has the following zero degradation
                 flavor: in every stable run of the algorithm (when all
                 failures are initial crashes, and failure detection is
                 reliable), two communication steps are sufficient to
                 reach a global decision. The zero degradation flavor is
                 particularly important when consensus is used in a
                 repeated form: failures in one consensus instance do not
                 impact performance of future consensus instances. We
                 describe our algorithm informally as well as in a
                 detailed way, and then we give two additional variants of
                 our algorithm, both preserving the zero degradation
                 flavor: (1) a variant that reaches a global decision in
                 one communication step in stable runs if all correct
                 processes propose the same privileged value, and (2) a
                 variant that uses a S failure detector (instead of \Omega
                 ). Roughly speaking, these variants convey the very fact
                 that our technique to obtain zero degradation can be
                 applied in various contexts.},

@TechReport{collisionFast,
   abstract    = {Atomic Broadcast, an important abstraction in dependable
                 distributed computing, is usually implemented by many
                 instances of the well-known consensus problem. Some
                 asynchronous consensus algorithms achieve the optimal
                 latency of two (message) steps but cannot guarantee this
                 latency even in good runs, with quick message delivery
                 and no crashes. This is due to collisions, a result of
                 concurrent proposals. Collision-fast consensus
                 algorithms, which decide within two steps in good runs,
                 exist under certain conditions. Their direct application
                 to solving atomic broadcast, though, does not guarantee
                 delivery in two steps for all messages unless a single
                 failure is tolerated. We show a simple way to build a
                 fault-tolerant collision-fast Atomic Broadcast algorithm
                 based on a variation of the consensus problem we call
                 M-Consensus. Our solution to M-Consensus extends the
                 Paxos protocol to allow multiple processes, instead of
                 the single leader, to have their proposals learned in two

                and communication facilities whose real-time delays cannot 
                be guaranteed. The basic assumption behind our approach is 
                that each processor has a local hardware clock that proceeds 
                within a linear envelope of real-time. This allows to compute 
                an upper bound on the actual delays incurred by a particular 
                processing sequence or message transmission. Services and 
                applications can use these computed bounds to detect when 
                they cannot guarantee all their standard properties because 
                of excessive delays. This allows an application to detect 
                when to switch to an exception fail-safe mode.},

                in the sense that a process p knows at all times if its 
                approximation of the set of processes in its partition 
                is up-to-date or out-of-date. The protocol minimizes
                wrong suspicions of processes by giving processes a 
                second chance to stay in the membership before they 
                are removed. Our measurements show that the exclusion 
                of alive processes is rare and the crash detection 
                times are good. The protocol guarantees that the 
                memberships of two partitions never overlap. },

                 which are solvable in synchronous systems but are
                 unsolvable in asynchronous systems with perfect failure
                 detectors. Hence, both models are not equivalent in
                 this respect. This is because failure detectors give no
                 information on the causal relation between the crash
                 event and other events on the crashed process. This
                 means that you cannot decide whether there is still a
                 message in transit coming from the crashed process or
                 not. If you want to base a decision on this fact you
                 have the same dilemma as in FLP
                 \cite{Fischer:1985:IDC}. But if it comes to consensus,
                 both models are ok because you can solve this problem
                 in both. However, in synchronous systems algorithms can
                 be constructed with a lower latency degree
                 \cite{Schiper:1997:ECA} so more efficient solutions are
                 possible in the synchronous model.",

In contrast, we present a universal construction which results in disjoint-access parallel, wait-free implementations of any object provided there is a bound on the number of data items accessed by each operation supported by the object.",

abstract="We introduce the notion of permissiveness in transactional memories (TM). Intuitively, a TM is permissive if it never aborts a transaction when it need not. More specifically, a TM is permissive with respect to a safety property p if the TM accepts every history that satisfies p. Permissiveness, like safety and liveness, can be used as a metric to compare TMs. We illustrate that it is impractical to achieve permissiveness deterministically, and then show how randomization can be used to achieve permissiveness efficiently. We introduce Adaptive Validation STM (AVSTM), which is probabilistically permissive with respect to opacity; that is, every opaque history is accepted by AVSTM with positive probability. Moreover, AVSTM guarantees lock freedom. Owing to its permissiveness, AVSTM outperforms other STMs by up to 40{\%} in read dominated workloads in high contention scenarios. But, in low contention scenarios, the book-keeping done by AVSTM to achieve permissiveness makes AVSTM, on average, 20-30{\%} worse than existing STMs.",
