@TechReport{LABOS-REPORT-2007-002,
   abstract    = {The deferred update technique is a widely used approach
                 for building replicated database systems. Its fame stems
                 from the fact that read-only transactions can execute
                 locally to any single database replica, providing good
                 performance for workloads where transactions are mostly
                 of this type. In this paper, we analyze the deferred
                 update technique and show a number of characteristics and
                 limitations common to any replication protocol based on
                 it. Previous works on this replication method usually
                 start from a protocol and then argue separately that it
                 is based on the deferred update technique and satisfies
                 serializability. Differently, ours starts from the
                 abstract definition of a serializable database and
                 gradually changes it into an abstract deferred update
                 protocol. In doing that, we can formally characterize the
                 deferred update technique and rigorously prove its
                 properties. Moreover, our specification can be extended
                 to create new protocols or used to prove existing ones
                 correct.},

	abstract = {Atomic broadcast primitives allow fault-tolerant cooperation between sites in a distributed system. Unfortunately, the delay incurred before a message can be delivered makes it difficult to implement high performance, scalable applications on top of atomic broadcast primitives. A new approach has been proposed which, based on optimistic assumptions about the communication system, reduces the average delay for message delivery. We develop this idea further and present a replicated database architecture that employs the new atomic broadcast primitive in such a way that the coordination phase of the atomic broadcast is fully overlapped with the execution of transactions, providing high performance without relaxing transaction correctness},

@TechReport{199912/IC,
   abstract    = {Message ordering is a fundamental abstraction in
                 distributed systems. However, usual ordering guarantees
                 are purely ``syntactic'', that is, message ``semantics''
                 is not taken into consideration, despite the fact that in
                 several cases semantic information about messages leads
                 to more efficient message ordering protocols. In this
                 paper we define the Generic Broadcast problem, which
                 orders the delivery of messages only if needed, based on
                 the semantics of the messages. Semantic information about
                 the messages is introduced in the system by a conflict
                 relation defined over messages. We show that Reliable and
                 Atomic Broadcast are special cases of Generic Broadcast,
                 and propose an algorithm that solves Generic Broadcast
                 efficiently. In order to assess efficiency, we introduce
                 the concept of deliver latency.},

   abstract    = {Classic Paxos is a round-based distributed consensus
                 algorithm. Normally, proposals are sent to the round
                 leader and decided in two communication steps more. Fast
                 Paxos extends Classic Paxos by allowing also fast rounds,
                 in which a decision can be learned in two communication
                 steps without relying on a leader but requiring bigger
                 quorums. We extend Fast Paxos and allow yet another sort
                 of round with multiple quorums of coordinators. Such new
                 rounds have the same expected latency and quorum size
                 requirements as classic rounds but do not rely on a
                 single leader, providing better availability and allowing
                 load balance. Fast rounds and ours have a different
                 liveness requirement: the absence of collisions---which
                 may happen if different values are proposed concurrently.
                 However, collisions are inherently more expensive in fast
                 rounds. We apply our algorithm to Generalized Consensus,
                 a generalization of agreement problems that can use
                 semantic information to avoid collisions.},

@Article{Sch97,
   abstract    = {Consensus is one of the most fundamental problems in the
                 context of fault-tolerant distributed computing. The
                 problem consists, given a set P of processes having each
                 an initial value vi, in deciding among P on a common
                 value v. In 1985, Fischer, Lynch and Paterson proved that
                 the consensus problem is not solvable in an asynchronous
                 system subject to a single process crash. In 1991,
                 Chandra and Toueg showed that, by augmenting the
                 asynchronous system model with a well defined
                 "unreliable" failure detector, consensus becomes
                 solvable. They also give an algorithm that solves
                 consensus using the <>S failure detector. In this paper
                 we propose a new consensus algorithm, also using the <>S
                 failure detector, that is more efficient than the
                 Chandra-Toueg consensus algorithm. We measure efficiency
                 by introducing the notion of "latency degree", which
                 defines the minimal number of communication steps needed
                 to solve consensus. The Chandra-Toueg algorithm has a
                 latency degree of 3 (it requires at least three
                 communication steps), whereas our early consensus
                 algorithm requires only two communication steps (latency
                 degree of 2). We believe that this is an interesting
                 result, which adds to our current understanding of the
                 cost of consensus algorithms based on <>S.},

@TechReport{200232/IC,
   abstract    = {This paper describes a new consensus algorithm for the
                 asynchronous message passing system model augmented with
                 an unreliable failure detector abstraction: channels are
                 reliable, processes can fail by crashing, and the
                 detection of crashes are not reliable. Our algorithm (a)
                 matches all known consensus lower bounds on (1) failure
                 detection, i.e., \Omega, (2) resilience, i.e., a majority
                 of correct processes, and (3) latency, i.e., two
                 communication steps for a global decision in nice runs
                 (when no process crashes and the failure detection is
                 reliable), and (b) has the following zero degradation
                 flavor: in every stable run of the algorithm (when all
                 failures are initial crashes, and failure detection is
                 reliable), two communication steps are sufficient to
                 reach a global decision. The zero degradation flavor is
                 particularly important when consensus is used in a
                 repeated form: failures in one consensus instance do not
                 impact performance of future consensus instances. We
                 describe our algorithm informally as well as in a
                 detailed way, and then we give two additional variants of
                 our algorithm, both preserving the zero degradation
                 flavor: (1) a variant that reaches a global decision in
                 one communication step in stable runs if all correct
                 processes propose the same privileged value, and (2) a
                 variant that uses a S failure detector (instead of \Omega
                 ). Roughly speaking, these variants convey the very fact
                 that our technique to obtain zero degradation can be
                 applied in various contexts.},

@TechReport{collisionFast,
   abstract    = {Atomic Broadcast, an important abstraction in dependable
                 distributed computing, is usually implemented by many
                 instances of the well-known consensus problem. Some
                 asynchronous consensus algorithms achieve the optimal
                 latency of two (message) steps but cannot guarantee this
                 latency even in good runs, with quick message delivery
                 and no crashes. This is due to collisions, a result of
                 concurrent proposals. Collision-fast consensus
                 algorithms, which decide within two steps in good runs,
                 exist under certain conditions. Their direct application
                 to solving atomic broadcast, though, does not guarantee
                 delivery in two steps for all messages unless a single
                 failure is tolerated. We show a simple way to build a
                 fault-tolerant collision-fast Atomic Broadcast algorithm
                 based on a variation of the consensus problem we call
                 M-Consensus. Our solution to M-Consensus extends the
                 Paxos protocol to allow multiple processes, instead of
                 the single leader, to have their proposals learned in two
                 steps. },
