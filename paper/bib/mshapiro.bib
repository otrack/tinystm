   abstract    = {The paper addresses the cost of consensus algorithms. It
                 has been shown that in the best case, consensus can be
                 solved in two communication steps with f < n/2, and in
                 one communication step with f < n/3 (f is the maximum
                 number of faulty processes). This leads to a dilemma when
                 choosing a consensus algorithm: greater efficiency or
                 higher resiliency degree. Recently Lamport has proposed a
                 solution called Fast Paxos, for partly escaping from this
                 dilemma. The idea is to combine two types of rounds in a
                 single consensus algorithm: fast rounds and rounds of the
                 ordinary Paxos algorithm. In the best case, Fast Paxos
                 solves consensus in one fast round, that is it requires
                 only one communication step. Unfortunately, the
                 combination induces some time overhead, and so Fast Paxos
                 becomes more expensive than ordinary Paxos when fast
                 rounds do not succeed. In this paper we go one step
                 further: we show that it is possible to tentatively
                 execute a fast round before a classical round without any
                 time overhead if the fast round does not succeed.},
