\title{A Locality-Aware Software Transactional Memory}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Software transactional memory (STM) guarantees that a sequence of operations encapsulated into a transaction is atomic.
  This simple yet powerful paradigm is a promising direction for writing concurrent applications.
  %
  Recent STM designs employ a time-based approach to leverage the performance advantage of invisible reads.
  With the advent of many-core architectures and non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA),
  this design is however hitting the synchronization wall of the cache coherency protocol.
  %
  In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible approach to address this limitation.
  Our idea is to leverage the parallelism and the locality of applicative workloads to execute few global operations.
  To that end, we introduce a new STM design that supports invisible reads, lazy snapshots 
  and can be tailored to be either disjoint access parallel, or NUMA-aware.
  Several empirical comparisons against a well-established STM design demonstrate that our design greatly improve perfmance\vs{check it matchs eval content}.
