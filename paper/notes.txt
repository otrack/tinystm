-- Software Transactional Memory for Dynamic-Sized Data Structures (DSTM)
Java based (encapsulated trans. object)
inccurs O(r^2) operations
require a contention manager to ensure OF
(namely, a transaction running solo must eventually
have the permission to abort another conflicting transaction)


-- The PCL Theorem. Transactions cannot be Parallel, Consistent and Live.
OF \land CAP \land C >= WAD |- \false
(w. WAD ~ SI|PRAM)

-- Maintaining Consistent Transactional States without a Global Clock [TLC]


-- Disjoint-Access Parallelism: Impossibility, Possibility, and Cost of Transactional Memory Implementations (Sebastiano, PODC 15)
"However, the invisibility of read-only transactions as well
as their ability to always commit in a finite number of steps
(wait-freedom), are desirable requirements for enhancing the
performance of TM in case of read-dominated workloads."
