Transactional memory systems must handle a tradeoff between consistency and performance.
It is impractical to take into account all possible combinations of read and write conflicts, as it would lead to largely inefficient solutions.
%% For instance, accepting $\RCAD$ histories brings only a small performance benefits in the general case~\cite{hans16}.

%Inspired by line of research, 
This paper introduces a new consistency criterion, named stricter serializability ($\SPSER$).
Workloads executed under $\SPSER$ are opaque when the object graph forms a tree and transactions traverse it top-down.
We present an algorithm to attain this criterion together with a proof of its correctness.
Our evaluation based on a fully implemented prototype demonstrates that such an approach is very efficient in weakly-contended workloads.
