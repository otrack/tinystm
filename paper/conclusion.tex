\section{Conclusion}
\labsection{conclusion}
This paper presented a new consistency criteria, \emph{i.e.} Stricter Serializability, designed to take advantage of modern CPU architectures.
We provided formal proof of its correctness as well as a prototype implementation.
Our evaluation study demonstrated that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art systems and implementations for most of the workloads. 
We plan to release our implementation as open-source to facilitate experimental reproducibility.
